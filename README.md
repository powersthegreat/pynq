# PYNQ

This repository holds common walkthroughs, example files, and images for AMD's PYNQ SoC platform. Each subfolder holds a seperate README.md describing the folders use and a example build. The following information is an exerpt from the <a href="http://github.com/Xilinx/PYNQ/" target="_blank">PYNQ github</a> overviewing the platform and its uses.

## About
PYNQ is an open-source project from Xilinx that makes it easy to design embedded systems with Zynq All Programmable Systems on Chips (APSoCs). Using the Python language and libraries, designers can exploit the benefits of programmable logic and microprocessors in Zynq to build more capable and exciting embedded systems.
PYNQ users can now create high performance embedded applications with
-	parallel hardware execution
-	high frame-rate video processing
-	hardware accelerated algorithms
-	real-time signal processing
-	high bandwidth IO
-	low latency control

See the <a href="http://www.pynq.io/" target="_blank">PYNQ webpage</a> for an overview of the project, and find <a href="http://pynq.readthedocs.io" target="_blank">documentation on ReadTheDocs</a> to get started. 

## Precompiled Image

The project currently supports <a href="http://www.pynq.io/board.html" target="_blank">multiple boards</a>. 

You can download a precompiled image, write the image to a micro SD card, and boot the board from the micro SD card. 

## Quick Start

See the <a href="http://pynq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html" target="_blank">Quickstart guide</a> for details on getting started with a PYNQ-enabled board.
